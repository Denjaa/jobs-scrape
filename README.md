# Project to scrape jobs 

I am currently looking for new opportunities as a result of restructuring changes at my current employer. I am skilled in Python, data engineering, SQL, Machine Learning and AI and data analytics.

I am sharing a code that goes into one of the Irish job advertising websites and scrapes the data for the positions that are being advertised. The code is built this way that ones it is activated it will check for database and if it does not exist it will create one to store the data. Otherwise, it will add more data to existing database. Code is taking in arguments from user for location and position user is looking for. All locations codes can be found in help function.

More advanced technical people can easily modify class with code to scrape more additional data if needed. Furthermore, they are add alert that will show them if new position is available so they would be first person to apply for that position.

Trick: if you leave arguments as " " it will scrape all positions available for all locations.
